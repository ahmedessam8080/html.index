incorrect operations.
            Any decidable type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also
            prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have
            type loopholes, usually unchecked casts that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally
            disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to type
            check programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, infer types, relieving the programmer
            from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as type
            theory.

            Programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for
            communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing language families of related
            languages branching one from another.[50][51] But as artificial constructs, they also differ in fundamental
            ways from languages that have evolved through usage. A significant difference is that a programming language
            can be fully described and studied in its entirety since it has a precise and finite definition.[52] By
            contrast, natural languages have changing meanings given by their users in different communities. While
            constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose,
            they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has.

            Many programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with
            other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one
            "universal" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted
            as filling this role.[53] The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts
            in which languages are used:

            Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of
            programmers.
            Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else to experts who may be
            comfortable with considerable complexity.
            Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from
