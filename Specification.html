microcontrollers to
            supercomputers.
            Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification.
            Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing
            them in a particular language.
            One common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems
            using a higher level of abstraction. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the
            underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed, features have been added
            that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware
            instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do
            more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets them write more functionality per time
            unit.[54]

            Natural language programming has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for
            programming. However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate. Edsger W. Dijkstra took
            the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless
            constructs, and dismissed natural language programming as "foolish".[55] Alan Perlis was similarly
            dismissive of the idea.[56] Hybrid approaches have been taken in Structured English and SQL.

            A language's designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of
            programming. The most important of these artifacts are the language specification and implementation.

            Main article: Programming language specification
            The specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can
            use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language, and if so what its
            behavior shall be.

            A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following:

            An explicit definition of the syntax, static semantics, and execution semantics of the language. While
            syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in natural language
            (e.g., as in the C language), or a formal semantics (e.g., as in Standard ML[57] and Scheme[58]
            specifications).
