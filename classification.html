    Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement
    algorithms.
    Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a
    set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages.
    The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and
    semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming
    language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant
    implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by
    a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.
