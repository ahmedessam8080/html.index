The static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to
express in standard syntactic formalisms.[2] For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include
those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time. Examples include checking that every identifier is
declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a
case statement are distinct.[45] Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers
are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that subroutine
calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a
logic called a type system. Other forms of static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part of
static semantics. Newer programming languages like Java and C# have definite assignment analysis, a form of
data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics.
Once data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example,
the semantics may define the strategy by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which
control structures conditionally execute statements. The dynamic semantics (also known as execution
semantics) of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program
behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the
execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research went
into formal semantics of programming languages, which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal
manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and
implementation outside academia.
A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types, how it can
manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a
certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain
